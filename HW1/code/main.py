Explore the training of these two classifiers and monitor the graidents/weights for each step. 
Hint: First, set two learning rates the same, check the graidents/weights for the first batch in the first epoch. What are the relationships between these two models? 
Then, for what leaning rates, we can obtain w_1-w_2= w for all training steps so that these two models are equivalent for each training step.
